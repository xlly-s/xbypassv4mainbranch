Hey, my name's crllect, I started working on this proxy pretty recently, I think
It's coming along pretty nicely, if you encounter any issues, contact me on
[discord](https://discord.com/users/713488984596021291).

## Current features:

-   Pretty clean UI
-   Ability to view and clear search history
-   Uploading/adding custom CSS
-   Ability to toggle search engine
-   Both UltraViolet and Dynamic proxies are set up and toggleable.

---

## TODO:

-   Multiple tabs (this is going to be a separate project/repo)
-   Add Rammerhead as a proxy option
-   Add DIP as a proxy option
-   Change how to open the window, E.G. Embed vs New Tab
-   Tab cloaking (Favicon and Title, along with some presets)
-   Add CSS for ProxyConfig
-   Add my game lib, and also add 3kh0 game lib. Might also have a Ruffle embed built in. Depends if this gains any traction or not
-   On first open, make the user go to settings to add a theme, and add a brief tutorial on changing proxies and when to do so (very low priority)

If you even moderately enjoyed this, star this, and follow my GitHub. Add some PRs if you notice any easy bugs or stupid design decisions.

If someone could make some simple CSS themes using the built-in template that would be nice. I could do it myself, but I'm a little busy at the moment, and making some themes is time consuming if you want to make them look any good.
